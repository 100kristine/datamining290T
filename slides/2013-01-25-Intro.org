* Data Mining i290 :slide:
  + Jim Blomo & Shreyas

* Course Goals :slide:
  + Extract *information* from *data*
  + Understand techniques to find patterns
  + Apply algorithms to real data sets

* We'll Do Stuff :slide:
  + 30%: 10 Homework Assignments
  + 30%: 1 Midterm
  + 40%: 1 Project: Find, Mine, Report on Data
** Homework Details :notes:
  + HW due at midnight Thursday before class
  + Each 24 hours late is 10% off
  + HW will be turned in by GitHub pull request
  + Project will be submitted by email & presentation

* But Don't Worry :slide:
  + This isn't a programming class
  + Grades are based on understanding of the concepts, not the craziest project
  + Shreyas & I are here to help
** Help :notes:
   + We realize there's a wide range of technical skill
   + We will help get anyone up to speed in these technical areas

* This is a Graduate class :slide:
  + Perform well without supervision
  + Readings from both book and online documentation
  + TMTOWTDI
  + Getting frameworks working on your computer
** Style :notes:
   + More firehouse than spoon feed, you'll need to follow up for 
     understanding
   + Honor system: No copying code or answers. Helping each other with 
     concepts is encouraged, but document it.
   + Everybody has a different workflow.  We'll be covering the most basic.
     Great if you want to do something different, but realize we may not be able
     to help you as much.
   + Non ISchool students should email student ID from EDU account to shreyas and
     jblomo and we will get them ischool accounts.
   + You may want to use other frameworks for your projects. Great! But again,
     we may not be familiar with them

* Prerequisites :slide:
  + Basic probability: P(A), P(A or B), P(A and B), P(A | B)
  + Basic programming: Python
  + Basic command line: SSH, downloading, copying large files, running programs
    against data
  + Textbook: Han, J., Kamber, M., & Pei, J. (2011). _Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques_, Third Edition *(3rd ed.)*. Morgan Kaufmann.
  + Technology will be available on =ischool.berkeley.edu=
** Basics :notes:
   + "Probability of A", "Probability of A or B" "A and B" "A given B"
   + Most assignments filling in algorithm code
   + Project you may use any language, though we suggest Python.
   + We'll introduce any specific frameworks
   + Command line: cp, mv, less... Imagine you have a 10G file, how are you
     going to inspect the contents?

* Material :slide:
  + Process: from find data to mining it to visualizing results
  + Algorithms: all intuitively motivated, some rigorously studied
  + Programming: using algorithms against data sets
  + Discovery: finding information in self-defined project
** What will we learn? :notes:
   + Data mining not just about algorithms. We'll learn how to obtain, clean,
     and store data.
   + In real life, this is 70% of the job!
   + We'll cover many different algorithms, and dive in depth on several of
     them. But we're not going to get into any hairy math proofs
   + Programming is the best way to precisely describe an algorithm. It is also
     the way data mining is used in the real world.
   + Your own project should emphasize your passion. Again, real world requires
     you to grab data and squeeze information out of it without external help
   
* Lectures & Labs :slide:
  + Start with Q&A for at least 10 minutes
  + Expect to be asked a question
  + Breaks
  + Lab: Stick around and get the first question of HW done
  + Slides on http://jblomo.github.com/datamining290/
** Helpful tips :notes:
   + Helpful to me if you say your name
   + Sorry, I tend to forget names
   + If I am not calling on you, check to make sure you are on the class list!
   + I'm not taking attendance, but let me know if you can't make it so I 
     won't call on you

* Office Hours :slide:two_col:
  + We'll stay after class
  + or schedule a Skype call
  + [[https://piazza.com/class#spring2013/i290][Piazza]] for questions and
    announcements
  + Wait list will be processed normally until 3rd week... then I'll accept 
    everyone who's participated in class if we have physical room
  [[file:img/Office_Hours.png]]
** Details :notes:
   + I expect that everyone will be able to get into the class

* Hi, I'm Jim Blomo :slide:two_col:
*[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/obnsldacg355wqn/2013-01-08%2021.50.03.mp4][Hello Class!]]*

  + Cal EECS
  + A9 - Amazon Search
  + PBworks
  + Yelp
  + Lecturer

* Hi, I'm Shreyas :slide:
  + First year Grad Student (MIMS '14)
  + Also TA'd Analyzing Big Data class
  + I can be reached at =seekshreyas@gmail.com=

* Data is Important :slide:
  + Making decisions is a core part of humanity
  + Data can help you make better decisions
  + Challenge: extract information from data to improve decisions
** Decisions :notes:
   + From big to small; from planning to execution
   + Business questions: what is the ROI of this feature? Where to concentrate
     development?
   + Personal questions: Where to eat dinner tonight? What movie to see?
   + Improving decisions means improving quality of life

* Data is Important :slide:center:

** Nice example of data mining :notes:
   + Stop at 3:51
   + Had to work with external parties to get data (Yelp, city of Seattle)
   + Had to clean data (literally, sometimes he was just handed paper receipts)
   + Used regression analysis to discover patterns
   + created follow up questions
   + Used result to understand the meaning behind the data

* Data Mining ecosystem :slide:
  + Data mining is part of a process to make decisions from data
  + Intersection between statistics, computer science, data management, machine
    learning
  + Analysis & visualization often required
** Ecosystem :notes:
   + We'll talk about several ways to think about the process from data to
     knowledge
   + No universally agreed process, or black-and-white boundaries
   + Analysis: used at the beginning of investigations to understand data
     characteristics
   + Visualization: better understanding of the results of analysis or data
     mining

** Analysis vs. Data Mining :slide:two_col:
   + *Analysis*: manually investigating data. No algorithms.
   + Statistical qualities: mean, median, standard deviation
   + Histograms (manually set buckets)
   + Counts / Percentages


   + *Data Mining*: discovering patterns though automated algorithms
   + Regressions: fitting data to a model
   + Clustering: grouping data without manually set descriptions
   + Classification: identifying divisive features
*** Pedantic :notes:
   + Difference is subtle, but important for both the project and your resume

** Machine Learning :slide:two_col:
   + Programs that can learn from data
   + Focus on prediction, based on verified training data
   + Used in two ways: during DM, after DM
   [[file:img/Terminator.jpg]]
*** Uses :notes:
   + During :: assume we have training data, train on it, see how useful trained
     program is or find outliers
   + After :: Discover clusters, verify and label clusters. Use labelled clusters
     to train a program to recognize new data points

** Probability & Statistics :slide:two_col:
   [[file:img/Poisson_cdf.svg.png]]
   + Data describes real world events
   + Probability can describe real world *expected* events
   + Distributions can be used to summarize data, understand the factors behind
     its creation
*** Uses :notes:
   + Can "fit" data to a distribution, find outliers that are unexpected
   + An example: Poisson distribution describes the expectation of a particular
     number of events occurring.
     + Eg. pieces of mail. average is 4, but it can vary.  Is getting 7 or more
       pieces of mail really an outlier?

* Process :slide:two_col:
  + *Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)*
  + Selection
  + Pre-processing
  + Transformation
  + Data Mining
  + Interpretation/Evaluation


  + *Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining*
  + Business Understanding
  + Data Understanding
  + Data Preparation
  + Modeling
  + Evaluation
  + Deployment
** Common Themes :notes:
   + Figure out what you want to do
   + Get the data
   + Make sure it's OK
   + Understanding
   + Make a decision, test its effectiveness
   + Reading will cover another process, aimed at "Data Science", but basically
     applies to Data Mining
