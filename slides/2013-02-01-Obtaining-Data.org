** Operational Data :slide:
   + Most frequent in industry
   + Usually stored in databases best suited for transactional use
   + Challenge is reoganizing data to suit question
*** Data from production :notes:
    + Most frequently you'll have data that is being used by the application,
      and you'll want to find insights in it
    + We'll go into more detail in another class, but online use is
      optimized for small queries and small updates
    + Frequently just accessing the data in bulk is a software enginering
      problem:
      + ensuring long queries don't hold up production usage
      + joining across databases via software
      + understanding esotaric columns, like "flags"
    + Often will want to reoganize data to look like transactional

** Example :slide:
   + Find the user names with most "liked" reviews on Yelp

| user_id | name | flags |
| 25234   | Jim  | 0x200 |

| review_id | business_id | user_id | stars | text | flags |
| 282       | 52432       | 25234 |   4     | great place! | 0x1 |

| review_id | src_user_id | ufc_flags | flags |
| 282       | 8205 | 0x1 | 0x0 |

*** Distributed Data :notes:
   + At Yelp we have a variety of database tables, and those tables can be
     spread across different databases
   + At a minimum we frequently need to =JOIN= across tables to answer queries
     + eg. matching up user names with reviews from separate tables
   + It is possible the review table is only indexed on business ID, and so
     finding all reviews by a user is really disk intensive: make sure you're
     not slowing down the whole site!
   + An additional challenge is when the "feedback" tables are in a separate
     database: can no longer issue normal SQL queries
   + What are these "flag" columns for?
   + Exactly: no one knows. Often must look into code, or compare data to
     production representation to guess meaning. In Yelp, =0x1= often means
     "inactive", so we probably don't want to count that feedback

** Data Warehouse :slide:two_col:
   + Data located on same system
   + Organized for analytics queries
   + Requires extra maintainence and understanding of construction

   [[file:img/Ikea-Warehouse.jpg]]
*** No free lunch :notes:
   + A strong data warehouse can be a big improvement over operational data
   + Hopefully, someone has already cleaned, joined data in a way that makes
     sense!
   + Optimized for long running queries: less fear of brining down website!
   + But you must learn how that process was accomplished in order to understand
     potential problems
   + How to handle missing data?
   + We'll go into more detail about how data warehouse schemas compare to
     online ones later in the course

** Unstructured :slide:
   + Haphazard collection of data
   + Unclear what structure should be
   + Examples: Web logs, text, multimedia
   + Must extract structure eventually
*** Yelp JSON logs :notes:
    + When developing a web application, new context or details become
      important: how long did certain requests take? What link did a user follow
      to a website?
    + Relational Databases aren't well suited for these wide varieties of
      potential attributes that don't apply to all items
    + So the current work around is just to write all useful information down in
      a log, and extract what is needed later
    + Text, like business reviews, another example: desired structure changes
      radically between questions: How many words? Characters? What is the sentiment?
    + Pictures can contain attributes like color depth, length, width
    + First step of data mining is often imposing structure on data: the data is
      not inherintly unstructured, it just is unclear what the structure *should be*
      until query time

** Search Logs Example :slide:
#+begin_src log
193.139.1 jim [10/Oct/2013:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /search?query=headache HTTP/1.1" 200 9288
282.482.3 shreyas [10/Oct/2013:13:56:36 -0700] "GET /search?query=bananas HTTP/1.1" 200 2929
345.114.1 steven [10/Oct/2013:13:56:37 -0700] "GET /search?query=cold HTTP/1.1" 200 8232

#+end_src

| user_name | date | query |
| jim | 10/Oct/2013:13:55:36 -0700 | headache  |
| shreyas | 10/Oct/2013:13:56:36 -0700 | bananas  |
| steven | 10/Oct/2013:13:56:37 -0700 | cold  |
| anne | 10/Oct/2013:13:56:39 -0700 | flu shot  |
| lily | 10/Oct/2013:13:57:40 -0700 | i290  |

*** Imposing Structure :notes:
   + Extract only the rows we know follow a format
   + Format queries from some encoding (eg. URL) to standardized format

** External APIs :slide:
   + Better documented than internal data!
   + More limited in amount and detail
   + Commonly HTTP/REST based
*** Motivation :notes:
   + Comapnies are often searching for other ways to leverage their data
   + Both for immediate business purposes, and for brand recognition
   + Twitter more (in)famouse example
   + NYTimes another good option

** NYTimes API Example :slide:
   + [[http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api][Article Search API]]
   + http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v1/article?format=json&query=ballot&api-key=6578bab7f8c3808ce4c392edc9a793f0:8:5717915
*** Accessing these :notes:
    + More info on how to access these APIs is in the Web Archetecture class,
      but feel free to ask Shreyas or I about how best to access them

** Datasets :slide:
   + Download large, curated set of data all at once
   + Formats vary, but usually documented
   + Can be useful to combine with other datasets or APIs

[[file:img/kaggle-digits.png]]
*** Research :notes:
    + Datasets commonly used in research: can compare different techniques on
      same data to understand advantages
    + Sizes can range to a few MB to GB
    + JSON, CSV, XML all potential formats. Cleaning, organization for your
      question again becomes an important aspect
